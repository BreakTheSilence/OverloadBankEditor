# Overload Bank Editor

## Introduction
Welcome to the Overload Bank Editor! This tool is designed to help you manage and manipulate your sound banks with ease. Whether you're looking to transfer presets between banks, edit existing banks, or export your banks for sharing or backup, Overload Bank Editor has you covered.

## Getting Started
Upon launching Overload Bank Editor, you'll be prompted to select a working folder. This folder is crucial as it will store all intermediate banks and serve as the primary location for your ongoing work. Please note, the banks within this folder are copies of the original banks, ensuring your original data remains unaltered.

## Features

### Process Banks
The Process Banks feature is your go-to for transferring presets between banks. Here's how it works:

- You'll be presented with two lists of banks: one on the left and one on the right.
- Select a source bank from the left and a destination bank on the right.
- Upon selection, a list of presets within the source bank will be displayed.
- Choose the presets you wish to transfer. You can select individual presets or opt to 'Copy All'.
- Hit 'Copy Selected' to initiate the transfer. The chosen presets will then be moved to the destination bank on the right.

### Edit Existing Bank
The Edit Existing Bank feature allows you to fine-tune the contents of a selected bank:

- Select a bank to reveal its presets.
- Within this interface, you can sort presets, eliminate duplicate entries, delete presets (individually or in bulk), and rename presets by double-clicking on them.
- Additionally, you have the option to create a new bank or import an existing one from your computer. Importing a bank creates a duplicate, leaving the original intact.

### Export Bank
Ready to share or backup your bank? The Export Bank feature has you covered:

- Simply select the bank you wish to export.
- Click the 'Export Bank' button.
- Choose your desired save location. The selected bank will be exported to this location.
